# Spotify Profile | Template / Mock-Up (HTML/CSS)

## Disclaimer
Dont expect much from this repository AT ALL. this is a school project that was mainly branched out to friends as a quick template for them to use. But this repo will be updated here and there just incase.

## What is this?
What this Github repository is presenting here is a Template of what a [Spotify](https://spotify.github.io/) Profile would look like coded with [HTML](https://github.com/search?q=HTML&type=repositories) & [CSS](https://github.com/search?q=CSS&type=repositories). This is mainly a school project based off my current knowledge of HTML & CSS; so dont expect much.
