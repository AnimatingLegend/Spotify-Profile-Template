# Spotify Profile | Template / Mock-Up

What is being presented here is a Template of what a [spotify](https://spotify.github.io/) profile should look like coded with [HTML](https://github.com/search?q=html) & [CSS](https://github.com/search?q=css).

Dont expect much from this from this repo due to it being a template and a school project, but it will be updated here and there.
